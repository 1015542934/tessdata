tessdata
========

These language data files only work with Tesseract 4.0.0.
They are based on the sources in
[tesseract-ocr/langdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata) on GitHub.
(still to be updated for 4.0.0 - 20180322)

These have models for legacy tesseract engine (--oem 0) as well as 
the new LSTM neural net based engine (--oem 1). The LSTM models
have been updated to have integerized and hence faster versions of 
[tessdata_best](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best) on GitHub.

Get language data files for Tesseract 3.04 or 3.05 from the
[3.04 tree](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/tree/3.04.00).

More information and a complete list of all languages is available in the
[Tesseract wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Data-Files).
